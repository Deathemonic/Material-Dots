# Material-Dots
The dotfiles that use your wallpaper at it's colorscheme


* This will have a bunch of hacks
* Will use pywall
* Inspired by https://github.com/PoSayDone/.dotfiles_new (But without the blur, I just don't like blur)
* Powered by Python like SweetDots (Probably will change to lua)
* Probably will use Rust or C++ as the backend
* Will support multiple window managers (Hopefully wayland)


Will work on it after I finish **`SweetDots`**
